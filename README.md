# Ninja Frog Adventure 🐸🎮

Ninja Frog Adventure is a 2D platformer developed in Unity as part of my learning journey into game development and C# programming.

## 🎯 Objective
You play as a ninja frog navigating through traps, moving platforms, falling rocks, trampolines, and other obstacles to reach the end of the level.

## 🛠️ Features
- Smooth 2D player movement and double jump
- Camera checkpoints
- Moving and falling platforms
- Fire and spike traps with animations
- Audio feedback for actions (jump, win, hit, etc.)
- Win and Game Over screens
- Object pooling for temporary sounds
- Modular scripts with clean structure

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Rigidbody2D and physics-based mechanics
- Coroutines for sequencing events
- Handling animations via Animator
- Working with collisions and triggers
- Organizing code with regions and summaries
- Using Unity’s UI system for menus and game states

## 🎮 Tech Stack
- Unity Engine
- C#
- Unity Animator, Rigidbody2D, Colliders, and Triggers
